# DragonEngine LUT Tools
A few scripts for usage with Dragon Engine LUTs

# Usage:

# 1. Convert LUTs to BMP:

cud2bmp.exe '3dlut folder'

To use next script you need to batch convert bmp files, that script above exported, to png and move them to separate folder.
Alternatively you can download a package that contains pre-converted LUT files and a sample screenshot.

# 2. Apply LUTs to the specific screenshot without any LUTs:

LexusLUTApplier.js 'folder with PNG LUT files' 'screenshot'
