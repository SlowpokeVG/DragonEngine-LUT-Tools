# DragonEngine LUT Tools
A few scripts for usage with Dragon Engine LUTs
Usage:
Convert LUTs to BMP:
cud2bmp.exe <3dlut folder>

To use next script you need to batch convert bmp files, that script above exported, to png and move them to separate folder.
Alternatively you can download a package that contains pre-converted LUT files and a sample screenshot.

Apply LUTs to the specific screenshot without any LUTs:
LexusLUTApplier.js <folder with PNG LUT files> <screenshot>
